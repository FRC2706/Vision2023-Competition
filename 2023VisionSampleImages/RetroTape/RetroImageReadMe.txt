Measurements in the filename are an approximate distance from the Red Alliance Wall wall to the camera, 
measured perpendicular to the wall.

"Straight" images are taken facing approximately perpendicular to the Alliance Wall. "Angled" images are taken
at an arbitrary angle to the wall.

The location descriptors are rough descriptors of the location along the width of the field while facing the Red
Alliance Community/Alliance Wall.
